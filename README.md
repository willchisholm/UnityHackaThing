# Will's Hack-a-Thing!

## What I Built

For my Hack-a-Thing I decided to teach myself Unity from tutorials on the web.
I first did a more basic tutorial that explored the layout of the software and the
basics of how to use it. After that I moved on to one that helped you create a 2D
platformer. Finally I followed a tutorial that taught me to create a 2 player tank
battling game.

## What I learned

I learned how to navigate Unity and gained some basic skills with it. I also learned
how to integrate scripts into Unity and what these scripts should look like. I'd be
comfortable after this assignment taking on more and larger Unity projects

## What didn't Work

I encountered some issues using git with this assignment due to the large size of the
files in Unity. I was unable to push my files to git for a long time and even with
git lfs it was a challenge getting my files uploaded to git.
